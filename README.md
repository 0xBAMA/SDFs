# SDFs
Experimenting with SDFs - Built on NQAE

## Information on the Previous Iterations of this Project:
- [Part 1: Basic bitcrush dithering](https://jbaker.graphics/writings/sdf1.html)
- [Part 2: More experiments with SDF techniques and dithering in different color spaces](https://jbaker.graphics/writings/sdf2.html)

### Plans for part 3:
This has been a little while coming. I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do with it, while dealing with the ongoing feature creep of Voraldo 1.2. On the plus side, that's been a good opportunity to get up to speed on SDF methodology (folds and other space manipulation, plus a huge range of starting primitives).

- dithering in even more color spaces, perhaps blending a few different results together?
- soft shadows
- maybe higher resolution (320x240 to 640x480, but we'll see)
- multisampling the initial raymarching result
- experimenting with distance estimated fractals
- a scheme for refractive objects (lens shapes)
- cycled blue noise dithering using the golden ratio trick
